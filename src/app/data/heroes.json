      "description": "By tapping into the Speed Force, Wally can run, think, and act faster than light itself, and as impressive as that is, it doesn’t end there. He can also move through time, phase through matter, and even read/acquire knowledge at a hyper-accelerated rate.",

      "description": "Superman is one of the most well known and powerful DC superheroes. With only one weakness, the Man of Steel is not fun to fight against. Although he isn’t in the #1 spot on our list, he easily could be, especially since no one is completely sure of just how powerful Superman really is (he’s always holding back). Regardless, as one of the most respected superheroes in the universe, this Kryptonian is the real OG.",

      "description": "Wonder Woman has taken the superhero movie genre by storm in the Wonder Woman movie. Essentially a combination of Superman’s power and Batman’s fighting skills, the one thing keeping Wonder Woman from ranking any higher is her lack of perfect invulnerability. Granted, she can certainly withstand more than her share of blunt force trauma, but a really sharp weapon could do some damage.",

      "description": "A Marvel superhero, Thor is the Norse God of thunder. Thor is not only invincible in almost every sense of the word, but he takes the meaning of “skilled warrior” to an entirely new level. Moreover, he has a hammer that gives him almost absolute control over space and time.",

      "description": "We know this isn’t going to make us any friends, but ever since “super sayain” became a household word, Goku found his way somewhere to the top of the really powerful superheroes list – albeit a somewhat non-standard superhero at that. But seriously, here we have a character essentially constructed on the assumption that there is no upper power limit whatsoever.",

      "description": "As the king of a certain offshoot of humanity known as the “inhumans,” the Black Bolt has been described even by other superheroes as one of the most powerful beings in the universe. Capable of some serious energy manipulation, the Bolt can use this power to increase any of his abilities to ridiculous levels. His greatest weapon, however, is his thunderous voice. Even a whisper has shown itself capable of shattering the Hulk’s bones, and it has been said that a shout would destroy an entire planet.",

      "description": "In possession of the “most powerful weapon in the universe,” the power ring wielded by the Green Lantern grants him abilities that are seemingly limited only by his imagination. He’s also one of the key figures in the DC universe. The only real downside is that like any other super cool gadget, it has to be recharged, and usually when it’s needed most.",

      "description": "Mercilessly executed by his own men, Al Simmons was once the government’s top soldier and most effective assassin. While in hell, he made a deal with the Devil that would grant him the ability to do virtually anything that he wanted. The catch? His powers would eventually run out and drag him back to the pit from whence he came.",

      "description": "Although Wolverine doesn’t have any of the typical superhero powers, it’s the intangibles that put him on the list. What he lacks in raw power he makes up for with pure fury and an epic complex backstory. And as we’ve seen with Dr. Manhattan, attitude is half the battle.",

      "description": "As one of the most powerful telepaths in the universe, Jean Grey sometimes has trouble keeping her nearly unlimited mental powers in check. Professor X was even forced to construct psychic shields in her mind as a child in order to prevent her from fully realizing her power until she was mature enough to handle it on her own.",

      "description": "When it comes to pure, raw, unadulterated power, there are few people that come even close to the doctor. In fact, there is almost no defined limit to what he can do. The reason he is at #20 however, is due to his primary weakness (besides tachyons) – apathy. In spite of being able to annihilate essentially the entire universe, he just doesn’t care enough about much of anything and would prefer to be left alone.",

      "description": "Although Iron Man has had his weak moments, his armor has proven itself worthy against the likes of Thor, Hulk, and other superheroes on this list. He’s also shown that he has enough swag to get his own list. Also, given that he’s constantly evolving, we wouldn’t be surprised to see him continue crawling up the power charts.",

      "description": "Formerly known as Mrs. Marvel, Captain Marvel (a.k.a. Carol Danvers) was an Air Force pilot, C.I.A. agent, and N.A.S.A. security director before an encounter with a Kree explosive and a Kree warrior gave her the power to become Captain Marvel. With her powers of strength, flight, and energy blasts, we hope she is strong enough to save the Avengers in Avengers 4!",
